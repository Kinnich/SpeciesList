# Wildlife Tracker - Local Species Guide
This is a simple app built on iNaturalist API and Pulze AI to:
1. List the wildlife observed in a given area
2. Describe the tracks and signs made by the animal

This is meant to aid in learning basic tracking skills and develop
a greater understanding for what you see when you look around outside.
